## notes

**major concept**
on a 1.0.0 version:

- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
- MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner
- PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes
- can add alpha, beta, prerelease
- stay on 0.x.x until first stable build

---

- versions are specified:
  - in the build.gradle (v0.0.1-SNAPSHOT) what is this snapshot
  - in the github tag (v0.0.1-alpha)
  - in the github release (v0.0.1-alpha)
  - possibly in the github branch created for this release (eg releases/v0.0.1-alpha)
- steps required: create a release with its tag
- publish

- what does this command do?
- does it read the v from the gradle file?
- does it bump automatically?

- how to create a semver based on current project vers and automatically bump it?
- with changelogs?

```groovy
./gradlew -Pversion=${version} publish
```
